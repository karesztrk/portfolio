              I currently work at an outsourcing company called Minero. Here I've learn a lot. This is not just about
              the enormous technical stuff but the way of delivering products to a customer in a mature way.

              Working at this company was my first step to build applications to end-users. It taught all the challenges
              that can occur once the application becomes live.

              I've started to work in the University before my graduation. Working and studying in parallel was not an
              easy way of life. But it certainly shaped and prepared me for life.
