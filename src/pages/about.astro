      <p>
        Hello there, I'm K√°roly! üåü I call the charming city of
        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/iS7ynsLC4MXW1kZJ8">Szeged</a>, Hungary my
        home. Professionally, I've been a Software Developer since 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
        My educational journey led me to the University of Szeged, where I laid
        the foundation for my career. I jumped into the world of work soon after
        graduation. Back then, we were utilizing Server Faces technology to
        deliver content and functionality, which steered me towards considering
        myself a Backend developer. Java became my trusty programming companion.
        However, I'm no stranger to keeping up with the ever-evolving trends.
        Building pixel-perfect, dynamic, and lightning-fast applications has
        become my passion, with a simple equation:
        HTML&nbsp;+&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;+&nbsp;JS&nbsp;=&nbsp;ü§ü. Creating new things
        and conquering the challenges they bring is where I thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of my professional life, I wholeheartedly dedicate my free time
        to another obsession: Fitness! üèÉüèãÔ∏èüèä. My entire life, a little voice in
        my head has constantly urged me to move forward and strive for
        self-improvement. This drive to learn and grow is what keeps me eagerly
        pursuing new knowledge and experiences.
