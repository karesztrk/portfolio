    <h2 slot="title">Story</h2>
    <p>
      Hello there, I'm K√°roly! üåü I call the charming city of
      <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/iS7ynsLC4MXW1kZJ8">Szeged</a>, Hungary my
      home. Professionally, I've been a Software Developer since 2009.
    </p>
    <p>
      My educational journey led me to the University of Szeged, where I laid
      the foundation for my career. I jumped into the world of work soon after
      graduation. Back then, we were utilizing Server Faces technology to
      deliver content and functionality, which steered me towards considering
      myself a Backend developer. Java became my trusty programming companion.
      However, I'm no stranger to keeping up with the ever-evolving trends.
      Building pixel-perfect, dynamic, and lightning-fast applications has
      become my passion, with a simple equation:
      HTML&nbsp;+&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;+&nbsp;JS&nbsp;=&nbsp;ü§ü. Creating new things
      and conquering the challenges they bring is where I thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of my professional life, I wholeheartedly dedicate my free time to
      another obsession: Fitness! üèÉüèãÔ∏èüèä. My entire life, a little voice in my
      head has constantly urged me to move forward and strive for
      self-improvement. This drive to learn and grow is what keeps me eagerly
      pursuing new knowledge and experiences.
