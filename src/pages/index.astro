      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p >
        Hey, this is K√°roly <span>üëã</span> I live in{' '}
        <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/iS7ynsLC4MXW1kZJ8'>Szeged</a>, Hungary.
        And I am a Software Developer since 2009.
      </p>
      <p >
        I've finished my study at the University of Szeged. I've started to
        work here very soon. During that time we were using Server Faces
        technology to deliver content and functionality. Because of that I
        always considered myself as a Backend developer. And Java became my
        primary programming language. But as the trend changes, so I adapt.
        Building pixel perfect, dynamic and extreme fast applications
        because my obsession. HTML + CSS + JS =&nbsp;<span>ü§ü</span>. I
        enjoy creating new stuff and embrace all the challenges they
        require.
      </p>
      <p >
        In my free time, I usually obeying to my second obsession: Fitness{' '}
        <span>üèÉ‚ÄçüèãÔ∏èüèä‚Äç</span>. During my entire life there was something my
        mind which was telling me: move out and become better. Probably this
        is also the reason why I am eager to learn.

            Minero holds a specal place in my hearth. It is - my first
            employer in the private sector - a software consulting
            company. Here I've learnt a lot. This is not just about about
            the enormous technical stuff but the way of delivering
            products to a customer in a mature way.

            I've started to work in the University before my graduation.
            Working and studying in parallel was not easy way of life. But
            it certainly shaped and prepared me for life.

      <p>
        ≈†koda-Connect is a highly interactive Single Page Application that
        gives you the ease of remote vehicle management. Through this web
        application, the users are able to check vehicle status, health or
        even plan trips ahead. ≈†koda vehicle monitoring through a web
        browser has never been easier before.

        By being a full-stack developer for the first time, I really enjoyed
        the technical challenges that the project gave to me. Day by day,
        I've got familiar with the top Front-end technologies and soon I've
        become a passionate JavaScript developer. This excitement has not
        faded since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team taught me how professional software is getting delivered
        and how does the true agile development works.
